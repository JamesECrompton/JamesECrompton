            <h2>Improving Generation Speed and Quality of Stable Diffusion Images</h2>
            <p>Stable Diffusion provides a number of nobs to tweak the image generation process. I did some investigations around schedulers and wanted to share my findings here as you can gain drastically better images by using a good scheduler.</p>
            <p>By default Stable Diffusion uses a PNDMScheduler which does produce fairly high quality images, but takes many steps before the quality is high. The best scheduler Stable Diffusion currently has in my opinion is the UniPCMultistepScheduler which gives much better results
              even at low step counts. The final images are very high quality and I strongly recommend trying the UniPCMultistepScheduler. In an effort to learn this area, I spent some time on the PNDMScheduler and with some algorithmic modifictions I 
              gained drastically improved results, much closer to UniPCMultistepScheduler and in some cases exceeding.

              I have named my new scheduler the PNDMDetailScheduler as it uses almost the same algorithm as the PNDMScheduler, but with each step it agressively prioritizes converging on details for the image. It also converges the image quickly when at low step counts to get the best guess consistent image rather than an unusuable artifact ridden image. I will go through a few of my test results and then cover the scheduler code, algorithm, how it works and how to use it yourself.

          <TD>At 12 steps the difference between the default PNDMScheduler and my PNDMDetailScheduler are drastic. Both the PNDMDetailScheduler and the UniPCMultistepScheduler have produced high quality images quickly. The detailed scheduler has a slightly sharper image and is a little closer to the prompt.</TD>

          <TD><p>As the step count increases to 50 the default PNDMScheduler has caught up and created a beautiful image. The detailed scheduler has increased details on the walls, buildings, clothes and skin. The Uni scheduler has created a beautiful image with details similar to my PNDMDetailScheduler. The Detail scheduler's image does not have the slight blur effect of PNDMScheduler and the UniPCMultistepScheduler. Some people may like it better and some people may feel it is over sharpened.</p></TD>

          <TD><p>Trying something completely different I tested rabbit puppet images with 30 steps in a sprite sheet of panels where there are many subjects. This was the one trial where the Uni scheduler really failed. It created the same image many times rather than a unique bunny for each sprite, and they all look bad. The default scheduler is fair but the face looks indistinct. The Detailed scheduler is the clear winner but the mouth is not great on any puppet, the eyes and ears are far ahead of the competition and each image is slightly different.</p></TD>

The detail scheduler has created a detailed artwork the woman has made and is good overall but the face still looks slightly wrong, the feet have extra digits and is blurry with half a sandle drawn on her. The Uni scheduler has actually gotten worse and completely mangled the face.</p></TD>

            <h3>How to try the scheduler</h3>
            
            A fork of the diffusers repo is hosted <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JamesECrompton/diffusers">here</a>.
            Clone the repo and run the "test_detail_scheduler.py" script found in the root.

            The code for the detail scheduler can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JamesECrompton/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/schedulers/scheduling_pndm_detail.py">here</a>

            <h3>The algorithmic changes</h3>
            <p>The algorithm backing the default PNDMScheduler can be found in this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.09778.pdf">here</a>
              The Detailed scheduler variant is designed for two purposes
			<ul>
                <li> Produce images with increased detail and sharpness at higher training step counts</li>
                <li> Produce consistent and clean looking images at low step counts (~12) steps.></li>
                </ul>
              This is accomplished by two changes to the model output calculation done in each step. In addition this scheduler requires skipping the Runge-Kutta steps defined in the original paper.
      
              The first change for producing images with higher detail is to maximize the differences between the sample predicted in a step and the ones predicted
              in previous steps. Since the density distrubtion of the norm of the data converges as the step processing proceeds, always subtracting 
              from the previous prediction is advantageous. If our mean has already converged to the goal, this will result in very little change, if it has not 
              converged we will speed the convergence. The default approch of adding and subtracting every other sample instead of removing all previous samples results in a slightly blurred effect reducing the 
              quality and generated detail level of the final image.

              Original code:
		<p>
		<code>
              elif len(self.ets) == 3:
                model_output = (23 * self.ets[-1] - 16 * self.ets[-2] + 5 * self.ets[-3]) / 12
              else:
                model_output = (1 / 24) * (55 * self.ets[-1] - 59 * self.ets[-2] + 37 * self.ets[-3] - 9 * self.ets[-4])
	      </code>
		</p>
              New Formula:
		<p>
		<code>
              elif len(self.ets) == 3:
                      model_output = (59 * self.ets[-1] - 23 * self.ets[-2] - 13 * self.ets[-3]) /23
              else:
                      model_output = (163 * self.ets[-1] - 57 * self.ets[-2] - 29 * self.ets[-3] - 11 * self.ets[-4]) /66
              </code>
		</p>
              The code used to alternate between adding previous samples and removing previous samples from the current predicted sample, and now it does no adds so there is no more averaging. We also maximumally consider the difference between our current prediction and the previous ones as we should be heading in the correct direction and this will speed us on our way.
              
              At low step counts the density distribution of the norm of the data is wide, our current prediction will be closer to the target and we want to take more of it and less of the previous. If the previous prediction is already close to the current this won't matter as we will add as much from the current prediction as we subtract from the previous. If we are a ways away from the convergence point though, we push ourselves in the desired direction.
		</p>
              <img src="../img/Convergence.png">
		<p>
              The second change for producing consistant images at low step counts (<=18) involves harnessing the above technique to speed convergenze and then when we are a few steps from being done,
              purposely do a weighted average of the last few steps to converge at an image that will appear consistent.
              
		<p>
		New Code:
		</p>
		<p>
		<code>
              elif self.num_inference_steps <= 18 and self.counter == (self.num_inference_steps - 2):
                model_output = (45 * self.ets[-1] + 28 * self.ets[-2] + 18 * self.ets[-3] - 11 * self.ets[-4]) /80
              elif self.num_inference_steps <= 18 and self.counter == (self.num_inference_steps - 1):
                model_output = (8 * self.ets[-1] + 2 * self.ets[-2] + 2 * self.ets[-3] + self.ets[-4]) /13
		</code>
		</p>

              The result is a scheduler which produces a consitent image much faster than the base PNDMScheduler and almost as fast as UniPCMultistepScheduler. The final output 
              image is sharper and more detailed then either PNDMScheduler or UniPCMultistepScheduler.
